            <p>Theia Mania was set up by Oliver Howard in 2020 as a means to get his mates to pay him to develop their film. Instead of that, he got his mates to work with him and over the last year we've seen massive expansion. From working out of our flats to moving into a bigger unit with a little shop and most importantly, a beautiful darkroom to fall asleep in! We've always wanted to offer something that other photo labs don't and that's why we've set up an Archive. A harken back to a time where you could entrust your memories to a developer to keep safe.</p>

If you need anything, whether its a general question or a natter, fill out the contact form and we'll get back to you!</p>
